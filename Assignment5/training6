2/CD ./. Formally/RB or/CC informally/RB ,/, train/NN all/DT your/PRP$ managers/NNS and/CC supervisors/NNS in/IN the/DT company/NN 's/POS due-process/NN approach/NN ./.

3/CD ./. Decide/VB whether/IN you/PRP want/VBP a/DT panel/NN system/NN or/CC a/DT single/JJ adjudicator/NN ./.
A/DT panel/NN system/NN like/IN that/DT in/NN the/DT Bob/NNP Stone/NNP example/NN enjoys/VBZ such/JJ advantages/NNS as/IN high/JJ credibility/NN and/CC ,/, for/IN the/DT panelists/NNS ,/, mutual/JJ support/NN ./.

International/NNP Business/NNP Machines/NNPS and/CC Bank/NNP of/IN America/NNP are/VBP among/IN the/DT companies/NNS using/VBG the/DT single-adjudicator/JJ approach/NN ./.

It/PRP wo/MD n't/RB do/VB any/DT good/NN for/IN anybody/NN unless/IN employees/NNS know/VBP about/IN it/PRP ./.
