interesting part " can't hardly wait " happens human , many us , one part many us easily relate . character denise ( lauren ambrose ) , film's sole sarcastic member mocks everything goes film , one point sits couch looks totally bored . film wisely holds moment , nicely showing alienation midst large high school party . . . almost nicely . members audience ( read : ) , basically mirror what's going watching film . sit wondering we've even bothered see film long high school party probably never felt desire go first place . would actually highly recommend film satirized . , film filled bunch pathetic stereotypes much went high school . everyone's : jock , homecoming queen , nerd ( dominions trekkies x-philes ) , alienated wannabe writer , school spirit girl , pothead ( ) , wigger , etc , etc , etc , weirdly enough film shows superficial , lame , basically bunch losers . except denise , rolls eyes everything , easily becomes likable character even speaks ( yearbook entry , something done main character , quotes oscar wilde - definite pointers ) . unfortunately , writers directors take several major misteps way making admirable even likable film . film , said , portrays characters superficial totally ignorant everything . however , instead sticking , perhaps even going bit , let lie , actually make characters heroes . follow several , bunch moronic stereotypes shread humanity realism , tries tell boring overly melodramatic tales actually cared and/or identified . , certainly don't want revisit state . here's quick low-down : it's graduation , follow bunch seniors last night , otherwise known " american grafitti " , lesser extent , " dazed confused " cliche . formal followed drove aimlessly ; latter little bit featured big outdoor keg party . " can't hardly wait " opts big indoor keg party , little bit aimless driving , albeit i'm-whining-because-i-can't-get-a-girl-i-want brand . follow many people around , mostly trail preston ( ethan embry , " thing ! " ) , alienated writer , who's pining homcoming queen , amanda ( totally overrated jennifer love hewitt ) , entirety high school thinks shared moment freshman year freaking pop tart . she's broken football player boyfriend , mike ( peter facinelli ) , decides go party note he's written declaring " love " hopes he'll build guts give . . . even though he's leaving multi-week intensive writing program hosted none kurt vonnegut ( okay : ingenius vonnegut icky noxema spokesperson ? ) . since plot incredibly lame track record goes wouldn't able carry commercial let alone feature film , it's party , main characters , : william ( charlie korsmo , finally surfacing " dick tracy " ) , nerd ( dominions ) come ridiculous plan publically sabotage mike , who's humiliated years , gets caught drinking ; kenny ( seth green ) , wigger , decided party finally get laid ( uh huh ) ; denise , exceptional character , unfortunately gets stuck bathroom ( don't ask ) kenny two characters let characters allowed follow laws plot cliches point point b nary bit characterization involved awhile . ugh . main comparison film getting another film actually " american grafitti " " dazed confused , " two films embraced ultimately made humans many high schoolers ( mention extremely entertaining ) , john hughes films 80s , notably " sixteen candles . " big difference two film managed embrace even satirize main characters , equally entertaining fashion . film forgets satirize characters , ultimately tells story bunch uninteresting stereotypes . . . says it's okay . can't take film seriously , take fun , really good ? tell things like : liked direction , except couple too-over-the-top features , like way-too-glossy jump cuts ( it's like oxymoron ) obscurities . generally , though , elfont kaplan graceful camera movement , even manage capture altman-esque feel film time time ( thing note , though , hokey really admirable ) . actually like seth green , decade ( played young woody allen " radio days " ) - desintegration wigger character almost believable . . . almost . , course , lauren ambrose wonderful denise , one character could used , even though would changed entirety film . however , character denise really doesn't work film , really thought . she's far witty realized ( least first half ) belong film , whenever appears , automatically gives everything delightfully satirical tone . she's cynic intellectual ; she's interesting character provides entertainment even damages already damaged characters . may ruin film , least she's screen sit think " well , least we'll entertained . " couple things don't work : mike's character , suffers epiphany throughout film end acts though forgotten everything : much sacrificial lamb film general ; aimless , bitchy driving preston try get inability shack amanda - give break ; perhaps one thing doesn't work : jenna eflman's uncredited cameo angel - didn't work , nice try . basically worst thing film , real reason i'm giving low rating , refuses give us fully realized characters insists follow around complete stereotypes movies things inane unlike anything we'd . don't feel characters us , aren't stereotypes going motions worn subplots . acid test high school movies : capture feel it's portraying ? answer film . nice try , though .
