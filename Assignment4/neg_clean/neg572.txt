possibly years anticipated film finally arrives uk . smashed u . box office office records it's opening weekend doubt . good ? word , . i'll elaborate . story follows . apparently two islands dinosaurs . one dinos lived untouched mankind tourist attraction failed even opened . ( see jurrasic park . ) imgen , company funded jurrasic park , want reccover losses taking dinos island move new attraction san diago . realizing bad idea , proffessor john hammond ( richard attenborough ) decides send team document dinosaurs , rally public support preserve island . enter familiar mumbling man jeff goldblum agrees go told girlfriend already . , basically , . two teams , one sent catch move dinosaurs mainland , trying document , forced work together , fighting survival dinosaurs' firm intentions eating . fairly good idea , however it's let one slight problem . it's crap . two hours chase scenes gets way boring , way quiclky . add terrible script feeble attempts occasional characterisation end disinterested . becomes background noise mind starts concentrating things like , 'what's tea ? ' 'should cut lawn later ? ' ( yes , ) . it's shame really , spielberg lowered making essentially blatant cash , adds practically nothing far superior jurrasic park . creative genuinely tense scenes fabulous c . g . dinosaurs ( . rex's seen believed ) , nothing else recommend lost world . dissapointing sequel , indeed .
