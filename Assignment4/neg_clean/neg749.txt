sandra bullock high heels wielding chainsaw ? yup , it's gotta summer . thought pointless sequel gone way franchise films direct-to-video releases , port slams speed 2 : cruise control , gloriously godawful follow-up 1994 sleeper bus rigged explode slowed certain speed . gimmick , time , ocean liner rigged , well , crash stuff . sound exciting ? dennis hopper's disgruntled bomb squader , villain first film , given way willem dafoe's disgruntled computer programmer , maniac whose main beef something use live leeches , kid , self-treatment copper poison- ing . ( said poisoning induced prolonged exposure electro- magnetic fields , less ! calling dean edell . . . ) , overrides boat's computer , convinces crew abandon ship , sends remaining passengers , couldn't evacuate time , col- lision course destiny . ( oddly , one thinks . . . jump back boat . ) keanu reeves electing return-- perhaps read script ? -- job john mcclane goes jason patric ( sleepers ) , * second * la cop swat team member bus drivin' babe annie ( bullock ) dated . ( odds ? ) they're caribbean cruise pleasure , handful requisite stock characters , including deaf teenager ( ! ) crush hero ( ! ! ) also knows sign ( ! ! ! ) . ( thought raptor slam cool summer movie move ? wait till see feats * * little girl , stuck shipboard elevator ! ) bullock pesky , perky self , though ends far less screen time top billing suggests . ( paying attention bikini- tank- tops probably won't complain , however ) patric main man motion that's damn good , 'cause stops talk , he's slightly less monotone predecessor . ( first lol line ms . bullock : " i'd like boogie . " ) course , nobody front camera embarrasses quite way returning director jan de bont . also produced mess , insulting even lax summer standards . ( con air , buddy , father's day , romy michelle's high school reunion , murder 1600 , 8 heads duffle bag , anaconda , vegas vacation , meet wally sparks , metro , bevery hills ninja , relic , forgiven ) . worse , he's spent hundred mil premise doesn't even live title ! there's sweat-inducing motion ocean here-- two hours shaky handheld camera work handful cross-cut exteriors , leading big slam , love boat sideswipes oil tanker plows harbor town . ( oh , far we've come twenty years . remember simple fun seeing locomotive smash railway station silver streak ? ) admittedly , either aforementioned sequences worth price admission . it's rest movie-- hundred minutes-- that's pure nonsense . wonderful nonsense . know didn't intend , de bont done one thing right : he's created hands-down funniest film year . , , allow present things made laugh : o box big label : " fiber optic converter " o plain english , whole-sentence computer instructions o entire sequence devoted opening fire door o jason patric's character walks onto bridge immediately understands everything that's happening o ships' navigator speaks scottish accent actually gets say " canna override ! " o willem dafoe's amazing arm-mounted keyboard o two living , breathing adults ( bullock's character first mate ) told , step step , disconnect trip wire pin hand grenade . duh o " wait ! " screams ship's intercom o yet another damn dog peril o fishing reel . pontoon plane . memories weekend bernie's
