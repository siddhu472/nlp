thought " stigmata " would worst religiously-oriented thriller released year . turns wrong , " stigmata " merely boring self-important , " end days " completely inept fronts . it's silly , incomprehensible , endlessly stupid mess . guy like grew watching arnold schwarzenegger best , it's extremely disconcerting see big man ended . first time recent memory , arnold action movie ( " batman & robin " doesn't count ) fun . " end days " major stinker . movie opens vatican city , 1979 . catholic priests observed ancient prophecy , says girl born night satan targeted impregnation . impregnates 11 midnight december 31 , 1999 , world destroyed . pope orders protection girl , though priests believe ought killed . new york , night , girl born fulfill prophecy . twenty years later , meet jericho cane ( schwarzenegger ) , suicidal ex-cop drinking problem . working security guard hire , protecting local businessman ( gabriel byrne ) , actually possessed devil . assassination attempt businessman crazed former priest leads girl satan , christine york ( robin tunney ) . recognizing elements murdered daughter christine ( including ownership music box , apparently ) , jericho swears protect devil faction priests looking kill . many problems film it's hard know begin , starting concept ? casting arnold role like mistake begin . schwarzenegger persona , actor , putting role contradicts usual strong personality bad idea . arnold neither dramatic range speaking ability pull character tormented conflicting emotions . words , trying give dimension mistake . harrison ford , mel gibson , even bruce willis could played role ( they've played noble flawed heroes ) , schwarzenegger . several scenes attempt establish jericho's character ; one contemplating suicide , another crying loss wife daughter , even one devil tries tempt revealing christine's location offering old life back . none scenes really work , arnie isn't task . filmmakers would better making jericho strong , confident character ( like terminator , example ) , likes schwarzenegger excelled . one isn't believable way arnold plays . supporting cast tries hardest , gabriel byrne makes impact . prince darkness , he's suave confident . acts like one would expect devil act . problem script things make sense ( later ) undermines powerful villain . byrne out-performs arnold every scene together ( including aforementioned temptation bit ) , problematic causes audience start unthinkable : root devil . byrne's speech bible " overrated " actually starts make sense , mainly arnold's attempts refuting ( mostly " 'tis ! " variety ) feeble best . problem , arnold win , end , nobody really cares . kevin pollack plays jericho's security guard sidekick tries liven things comic asides , like bad action movie sidekicks , disappears hour . robin tunney isn't given much except look scared . fact , supporting players good actors , none , save byrne , given anything interesting . performances aside , would really hard enjoy film matter starred . action blockbuster , it's surprise worst thing script , starts totally confusing , explained ( much ) , it's utterly ridiculous . devil coming new year's eve , 1999 ? it's exactly 1000 years year devil , isn't 666 , turns . nutty priest accidentally read upside , real year 999 , add 1 beginning , you've got 1999 ! don't buy explanation , you're alone . it's convoluted silly time . method jericho locates christine york equally ludicrous ( she's christine , see , lives new york , see . . . ) , weren't bad enough , there's plenty bothersome stuff film isn't explained . satan kill everyone passes street , comes snuffing one drunk ex-cop , he's powerless ? impervious one kind bullet ? come can't control jericho christine ? gregorian monks deal time zones prophecies ? clumsy attempt joke made , it's never actually explained . usually , sort thing wouldn't matter schwarzenegger flick ( mean , don't get started time paradoxes offered terminator movies ) , time plot inconsistencies stand even usual action rarely exciting . several predictable horror film clich ? present " end days , " complete old " black cat hiding cabinet " bit , ever find cat . gets formulaic it's possible uninterested scared close eyes precise moment " boo " come . predictions rarely wrong . grandiose action sequences utterly charmless , partially don't care characters ( due script's pathetic attempts characterization setup ) , also , , don't make sense . there's scene schwarzenegger gets thrown around room little old lady . it's good chuckles , much else . supposedly we're believe super strength virtue controlled satan , script never sets , scene merely silly . none terribly exciting , action sequences badly framed it's often hard tell it's happening first place , mention they're edited full-on incomprehensible mtv quick-cut style . scratching head , rather saying , " wow , cool ! " " end days " silly confusing , it's also distinctly unpleasant watch . devil apparently doesn't operate subtle , i'll-convince-people-to-kill-each-other fashion outlined bible , instead enjoys killing people gruesomely broad daylight . doesn't make awfully predictable sort , also means single scene " end days " goes without unnecessarily graphic violence , odd kinky sexual encounter ( yet another bit scratching head ) . violence supposed shocking , it's good idea throw much movie audience goes numb . scenes aren't connected reasonable means , lot time , stuff gets blown , people get killed , idea . reasons ? hell reasons ! let's blow stuff ! isn't cool ? nope , long shot . film thoroughly unwatchable . it's dull , interminable , unrelenting stupidity . perhaps arnold needs make movies james cameron revive career , it's happening hack peter hyams . " end days " might camp value , didn't top overly pious ending nobody's going buy . movie going serious , filmmakers come decent script . it's going campy , arnold shouldn't taking damn seriously ( didn't actually see put cross , ? ) , character shouldn't sad sack . stands , " end days " bad movie , awfully gloomy one .
