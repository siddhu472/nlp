corruptor big silly mess action movie , complete pointless plot turns gratuitous violence . it's abhorrent , even blatantly unlikable , doesn't make shred sense . whose idea director glengarry glen ross direct action film ? james foley knows lot characters acting , strengths corruptor . quiet scenes clash ludicrous action nonsense , result less like movie like derailed train . least chow yun-fat lead role . chow plays nick chen , chinatown cop . he's good cop , first scenes establish , he's familiar chinatown . that's probably powers-that-be decide team rookie named danny wallace ( mark wahlberg ) . nick danny begin stepping other's toes , finally end liking get chance save one's life . happens kind mystery . i'm fairly certain villains part fukienese dragons , led young chinese psycho named bobby vu ( byron mann ) . i'm also pretty sure nick payroll henry lee ( ric young ) , gangster dealing prostitutes neat stuff . i'm quite sure henry lee decides employ danny , although makes ridiculous ( albeit unpredictable ) plot twists along way . there's also interesting subplot revolving around danny's father ( brian cox ) , doesn't much main story . one problems , said , movie doesn't make sense . don't blame entirely foley , he's obviously good director . i'm inclined point finger robert pucci's script , doesn't seem tune way normal people act . one scene early particularly annoyed : nick confronts boss he's angry new white partner . he's shouting pointing finger stepping furniture , thinking would fired done . ( addition , film takes bite race-related issues , never develops . ) lot scenes like one , none coherent . there's also considerable language barrier , given chow actors thick chinese accents . plot never straightens . i'm sure fukienese dragons , henry lee associated , group . corruptor action movie , weird plot developments decorated loud violent action sequences . sequences aren't bad , they're new ; many car chases chinatown seen ? note , many chinatown cop movies seen ? one many , i'd imagine . foley's strength clearly characterization , pretty good job . scenes nick danny good , actually got feel characters ; bond forms holds parts film together . chow wahlberg good actors ; chow pro , kind stuff sleep . wahlberg seems less home atmosphere , he's still fun watch . also liked subplot involving danny's father ; brian cox's performance powerful , character makes compelling moral compass danny . film ultimately fails , mostly hands insane incoherence overly-familiar action scenes . complicated plot successful , story needs make sense it's . corruptor never manages make sense -- keeps spinning control , finally , there's nothing left hold .
