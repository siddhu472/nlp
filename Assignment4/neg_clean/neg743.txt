" return horror high , " wants couple different types movies . film tells story low-budget horror movie filmed closed-down crippen high , school group serial murders took place five years . cast crew don't know real killer , maybe one never apprehended , going action . one level , " return horror high " slasher movie , level works best . watching film , made 1987 , couldn't help take notice killer's costume almost identital ghostface , " scream , " " scream 2 . " another level , film wants slapstick comedy , many hints throughout . unfortunately , jokes fall flat . last thing film wants " behind-the-scenes " look exploitation film made . problem , much supposed movie made , cameras shown filming , thus making far confusing . top , " twist " ending makes little sense whatsoever , basically left feeling wasted time . story developments beyond ludicrous , plot holes could drive winnebago . see film , seen , you'll know mean . premise " return horror high , " admittedly pretty crafty , liked atmosphere school , whole thing takes place . director froehlich , judging movie , incompetent director , except able film seldom suspeneful scene . well , come think , one scene actually scary , two actors locked room killer tries break . two-minute distraction , " return horror high , " certainly great shake . note : look george clooney supporting role one actors film . strangely enough , first character get ax . . . literally .
