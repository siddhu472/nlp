here's concept -- jean-claude van damme gets killed within first ten minutes movie . isn't enough get finally see van damme movie , don't know . sarcasm aside , certainly different way start movie , course minutes later find newly deceased twin brother -- lucky us , get see jean-claude . van damme #1 works russian mafia united states killed operatives . van damme #2 police officer france finds twin brother never knew #1 gets killed france . remaining twin ( french cop ) goes united states find killed brother avenge death . , hooks deceased brother's girlfriend , played natasha henstridge , two set discover murderers . jean-claude's acting abilities don't seem usual lackluster standards movie . words , case missed sarcasm , acting worse normal . upside , natasha henstridge film , best species -- gets naked . sadly , probably high point movie . actually decent actress , didn't improve much thought would species . typical van damme movie , jean-claude variety high end martial arts moves opponents . nothing new , certainly nothing haven't seen every van damme movie . simply put , absolutely nothing new movie . retread plot -- isn't first time jean-claude played twins . still can't act . saw natasha's breasts species ( although one repeat performance i'm complaining ) . pretty much like every movie van damme ever involved -- sub par .
