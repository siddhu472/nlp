stallone attempts 'act' cop drama . film set neighbourhood pratically built kietal , who's nephew ( played michael rappaport ) involved car crash killing two black youths . keital dosen't really want get involved anything , gets rid rappaport , stallone de niro try work hell going . film brilliant . sounds like great plot , actors first grade , supporting cast good aswell , stallone attempting deliver good performance . however , can't hold . although acting fantastic ( even stallone isn't bad ) directing story dull long winded scenes go long , nothing really happening . fact , scenes work action scenes , suspect stallone trying avoid . film , serious means dull . dialogue warbling , basically repeats points , matter delivering . plot , potential , wasted , cliched . fact , thing keep film going kietal de niro , delivering usual good performances . however , stallone , although given much say , gives good performance . however , it's bad . said , action scenes well done . theres also good ending , uses cinemas sound system well . fact , last 10 minutes 2 hour film one best endings 1997 . rest film good ending . cop land , , turns power house film , rather dull , every exciting film . hugely disappointing , can't really recommend .
