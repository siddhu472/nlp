first impressions : critically , close-to-awful film , money-wise , ( continue ) great . sometimes-funny film sags lags oftentimes gets boring . orginal plot grows old real fast . one 90 minute films i've gotten bored . men black defied odds . first saw flick 89 minutes long , thought maybe poor attempt independence day type film ran gas . however , realize men black run gas , film 90 minutes manages show original idea ( summer audiences embraced ) becomes old 25 minutes movie . tommy lee jones smith play two " government " agents responsible keeping order alien society . ridiculous plot begins alien " bug " , played weirdly vincent d'onofrio , great full metal jacket , lands earth retrieve galaxy that's somewhere " orion's belt . " anyway , basic plot revolves around jones smith stop bug getting galaxy , higher power blow earth . premise ridulous , didn't like film . love original plots . one original one . director barry sonnenfeld something film ruined plot : made film drag also put unncessary elements found romance films . whenever saw d'onofrio's bug stomp eat people film , got terribly boring . smith's wise-cracks fill gaps , wasn't enough . also , cannot believe screenwriters elected sub-plot tommy lee jones missed former lover alien agent , can't contact humans really . see jones , satellite computer , watching lover plant garden ? sentimental moment alien movie ? nice try , don't think . doesn't work . makes movie even ridiculous even boring : don't aliens worry , jones's conscience . came movie wanting see jones's conscience , wanting see real action movie lots aliens . maybe it's unfair partly judged movie expectations . nevertheless , even though parts indeed funny , plot movie grew old boring -- quick .
