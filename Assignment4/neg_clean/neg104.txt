opinion film easily swayed presence actors love . love ralph fiennes . love uma thurman . love sean connery . hell , i'm even big fan jim broadbent fiona shaw . saw fantastic preview avengers nearly eight months ago , i've eagerly awaiting film ever since . months summer , however , noticed release date changed times , ended mid-august dumping ground . , final week official release , learned screened critics . actors plugging film late night programs . directed man brought us remake diabolique . expectations fell pieces learned things . film saw today didn't even meet expectations . lousy , incoherent mess . would slam harder , weren't nifty sets mere presence fine , lovable actors . sets ultimately empty , performances completely uninspired . that's main problem avengers : it's hip-hop flash tidal waves , none feels least bit energetic inspired . it's like chore , bland exercise superhero film making . also feels like cut pieces , clocking 90 minutes forgetting close subplots . plain depressing . avengers film version popular 60s television show . frequent readers mine surprised learn i've never watched episode . wasn't alive . don't even watch television . i'm sorry don't perspective , , judging reviews i've already read , knowing tv show makes matters worse . didn't know love john steed emma peel , therefore upset see actors love managed thrash roles . also doubt familiarity series would allow understand clearly chain events take place film . based film told , gather steed ( fiennes ) kind british super guy ( somewhat like james bond ) , dr . peel ( thurman ) really smart doctor , also happens know lot weather beating people limited tight leather suits . work together , mother's orders ( mother played jolly jim broadbent , co-conspirator , father , played equally-talented fiona shaw ) . seems man controlling weather . name de wynter ( connery ) . crazy scottish guy . heroes better stop , else . . . weather keep getting colder " go hell warm " ( one film's funny lines ) . along way subplot subplot , hinged sloppily together scenes go nowhere , feel perfunctory , ultimately make sense . example , heroes eventually attacked swarm giant mechanical insects machineguns attached torsos . , killer bugs don't really go weather-controlling theme film . purpose bugs , annihilate heroes , never established . they're never even directly connected de wynter ( they're controlled crazy henchman , played eddie izzard ) . special effects aren't bad , they're loud , obnoxious , intrusive . like many scenes film , seems present keep attention waning . guarantee , wane . stopped thinking story realized didn't good think . avengers clearly chopped re-assembled many times even people involved couldn't tell us happens . several scenes preview didn't make final cut . addition , many sequences irritating , grainy film quality , makes feel low-budget ( last scene particularly bad ) . scenes don't feature action electric , thanks wonderful cast . aren't . action scenes electric , action film . aren't , either . wasted cast ? oh , makes weep disappointment . we're talking ralph fiennes , one best actors working today , one best actors * ever * . love guy . i've loved films , one . seems like wants understand film , he's lost . thurman , spectacular beauty talent , can't manage look home . ( don't blame completely , strange subplot involving evil twin never explained way , can't easy deal terrible screenwriting . ) connery , however , seems , totally lacking kind focus , interest , matter . blame ? screenwriter , macpherson ? perhaps , although see shell story could good superhero movie handled right . actors ? god's sake , -- people clearly lost interest saw inevitable path destruction film travelling . blame director jeremiah chechik , shouldn't given task begin . best film , benny & joon , quirky way one supposed , mostly seems like lot failed attempts wit humor . add lack experience big-budget action , worst choice director side james ivory . avengers saving grace , it's set design . sets ( stuart craig ) big , colorful , often pleasing look . like final set-piece , de wynter's island , even none makes bit sense . admired overhead view stairs , showing dr . peel running around circles never getting anywhere . also enjoyed michael kamen's music score , particularly opening credits . stuff routine -- good sets music nice , there's lot needs . inspiration , instance , would really nice . maybe little bit cohesion story . sense purpose . , though , would liked see actors relish roles . damn movie giving chance .
