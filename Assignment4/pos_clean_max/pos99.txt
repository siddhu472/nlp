[theater rating : * * * 1/2 : good sound , picture seats] title : `tarzan' beautiful look , easy follow . review : disney continues trend producing animated summer blockbuster movies meant mostly children enough wit charm adults interested least entertained story . basic premise every `tarzan' story : boy raised african jungle gorillas becomes one never really understanding ( even noticing ) he's human lot different animals befriends . first third film shows tarzan comes adopted kala ( voiced glen close ) , female gorilla lost child classic case darwanism . mate , kerchak ( henriksen ) , mean , conservative leader pack gorillas make tarzan's extended family . refuses acknowledge tarzan ( voiced alex d . linz childhood scenes ) son often hold back killing tarzan continually dangerous , wild things result childish instincts . feeling children quickly able identify tarzan since really kid wants fun it's funny adults fail comprehend . later , story transitions tarzan child full-grown man ( voiced goldwyn ) , encounter party three humans england : jane porter ( driver ) , beautiful woman something zoologist artist , father prof . archimedes q . porter ( voiced nigel hawthorne ) also scientist ; slick cunning , yet barbaric safari bodyguard clayton ( blessed ) . it's easy tell story going times screenplay doesn't seem like written hastily dumbed children's enjoyment . sure there's lot cliche stuff , like clayton's smugness diabolical manipulation tarzan jane ; goofy supporting characters ( voiced rosie o'donnell [in full brooklyn accent ! ] wayne knight - `hello newman ! ' ) . there's also lot fun action tarzan's swinging jungle vines sliding around tree branches trunks . it's like skateboarding really fast sorts tricks ( mcdonald's commercials really prove point ) . ultimately , get exactly `tarzan' expect . . . mean compliment , high expectations . pros : animation sound feast senses , story lighthearted , breezy dumbed-down , stupid sing-along songs get stuck head . cons : surprisingly violent , rated pg . young children may understand adult themes ( parents , ready heavy questions thrown way ) . running time bit short . would recommend friends ? friends , movie-going public would . score : 0 rating ) .
