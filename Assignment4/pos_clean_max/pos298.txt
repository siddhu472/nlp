director : penelope spheeris ( decline western civilization ii - : metal years , dudes , & suburbia ) cast : mike myers ( wayne campbell ) , dana carvey ( garth algar ) , : rob lowe ( benjamin oliver ) , tia carrere ( cassandra ) summary : wayne garth public access show called " wayne's : world . " show underground hit , benjamin : oliver comes onto scene . benjamin wants turn : show big hit nationwide , possibly destroying : essence " wayne's world " process . [expectations - medium] long review =========== must admit bit reluctant going film . didn't believe ( mike myers dana carvey ) could hold hour half , figured perhaps first half-hour would great , rest would " fluff . " however , really surprised well able keep laughs going virtually whole film , exception ending . ( won't discuss obvious reasons , it's * * bad . ) story : plot quite thin , really wasn't noticeable , rapid-fire jokes myers wrote . alot jokes similar hot shots ! , " parodyish . " ( okay , bad term . ) extremely witty throughout , although ( hot shots ) got bit repetitive middle . acting : many comedies , acting isn't really * * important . however , myers turns good performance wayne , playing character perfectly , ( although still liked better back much music , " canadian " type mode . ) carvey okay garth , lacks spark myers puts wayne . tia carrere mediocre cassandra , playing stilted . lowe fine ben oliver , nothing write home . without doubt , movie mike myers way . direction : spheeris classic " music " movie director , making dudes , decline western civilization ii -- metal years . ( also directed boys next door , different , say least . ) capable , knows direct comedy , correct camera movements instill laughs , etc . one better jobs remember comedy . overall : would suggest anyone likes snl's skits go see film theatres . however , personal opinion , comedies , work well video . definately fan music , forms media general enjoy film . without doubt , best comedy far year . it'll make tons 'o' dough everyone involved . let's hope make thousand sequels . [sorry , get lame joke . . . forgive . ]
