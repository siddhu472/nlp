one biggest cliches serial killer film also one believable . know , one detective looks wall pictures police information , suddenly spots clue reveals killer . sure , it's used , reason , always fun watch . cliche pretty much describes level kiss girls works : overused , always fun . one personal rules watching film original film , goes around giving story . rule applies highly kiss girls . something psychologically stimulating well-crafted serial killer movie , kiss girls certainly well made . however , whole film screams unoriginality , relies power actors technical detail pull . well , actors capable pulling , add much film nearly every flaw covered . unfortunately , one revealing rather insulting choices filmmakers ( one seven , film lot like one , knew make ) put name killer opening credits . may give actor credit role , throughout film , hidden mind , waiting appear screen , spoiled mystery . however , credit must given director suspending knowledge film . plotwise , kiss girls shows almost originality . introduced detective alex cross ( morgan freeman ) , forensic psychologist , immediately given cliched scene establishing hero . gets call woman shot husband threatening kill . obviously cross succeeds getting gun , scene quickly forgotten next scene . house , cross told neice , naomi ( gina ravera ) , missing four days . provides motivation cross find killer , never given chance establish relationship two , result , can't sympathize detective cross . however , makes kiss girls slightly original introduction one abductees . . . abducted . dr . kate mctiernan ( ashley judd , actress judd family ) smart , athletic woman , traits , becomes target casanova--what serial killer likes call . character-developing scenes , care mctiernan , making abduction scene suspenseful . abducted , mctiernan wakes finds cell somewhere woods . remembering killer gave certain rules , decides break one calling . casanova comes punish , breaks escapes jumping waterfall . found , begins help cross find neice . moment , kiss girls takes form every serial killer film , two leads search rest victims held captive . many people compare film 1995's seven , another killer film starring morgan freeman , presume similarities intentional . screenplay , david klass , adapted novel written james patterson , yet don't quite see story could worked novel form . makes kiss girls good acting technical visual impressiveness . cinematography , aaron schneider , reminiscient seven , sometimes felt many shots trying hard impress us . sometimes simple shot best one . however , many shots stunning , unlike seven , take place day , sunlight . scene ashley judd running forest extremely well done , one way . camera work terrific , editing makes scene work well . chaotic mtv-type cutting gives audience sense confusion unawareness , exactly judd's character experiencing . however , best aspect kiss girls actors . morgan freeman one today's powerful believable actors . detective cross good character , although similar one character seven . freeman's powerful presence , carries half film . half carried ashley judd , one today's promising dramatic actresses . fact , performance better freeman's , even possible . character original freeman's , handles wonderfully . finally female character movie like scream . supporting cast highly underdeveloped , cast members much . cary elwes portrays cop north carolina , unfortunately scraps character . tony goldwyn fairs slightly better , don't really get know character either . gina ravera gives good performance , isn't many scenes . result small supporting parts , weight film lies two leads , phenomenal job . best acting genre , best acting year . two essential aspects film quite good . director gary fleder good job controlling actors , second half film loses believability , especially revelation killer . also doesn't handle suspenseful scenes better director would , losing lot tension many scenes . however , credit , manage terrific first half . part blame falls david klass . i'm sure book developed many lesser characters , klass focuses two main parts . may give two leads screentime , many small characters one-dimensional , killer , revealed , extremely implausible . thanks smart dialogue adapted novel , kiss girls always seems intelligent . none conversations laughable , move plot forward without seeming forced . one biggest problems movie motive killer . blame mainly casting director , killer's motive rejection women ( assume opening monologue ) , killer attractive ( one friends , shall say , big admirer killer ) . kiss girls rated r terror , violence , language , suggested sex . implausibilities film , mediocre second half , kiss girls somehow manages thoroughly entertain . fact , urge see performances . cinematography adds lot mood already creepy tone , script usually smart . clearly one movies rely acting pull . morgan freeman possibly today's convincing actor , ashley judd adds another notch acting belt . must also say loved ending . showdown good evil quite tense , resolution scene makes almost anyone cheer . perhaps may possible , film isn't anyway
