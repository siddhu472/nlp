anxious see long time . friend mine recommended crush neve campbell , wanted prove she's hot thinks . proved right , reasons enjoy film go way beyond . scream treads familar ground , horror movie , star neve campbell puts , " stupid killer stalking big breasted girl can't act who's always running stairs running front door . " it's familar , typical horror film . , may ask watching , seem new original ? treats hasn't done , thus viewer disilusioned believing old , familar tired stuff . raises another question : ? simple : characters . they're typical stupid horror film victims don't know hell chased guy ski mask machette . horror fans , know stuff happens horror movie , know , makes scary , even funny certain times . tell watching opening scene casey becker ( drew barrymore ) making popcorn , getting ready watch video , guy sounds like killer calls play game involves horror movie triva , gets wrong , get boyfriend killed . knows answer asks horror film questions , can't answer final question , " door ? " gets killed . scene works normal horror film , half things happen scene would never happen . plot typical horror stuff : sidney prescott ( impressive neve campbell ) , attractive young high school student who's mother killed year ago tommorrow , stalked killer who's previously murdered one classmates ( casey , naturally ) , everybody small , california town suspect , including sidney's boyfriend , billy loomis . said , people know horror movies work , that's makes appealing . references horror movies , like casey says , " first ( nightmare elm street ) scary , rest sucked . " obviously director wes craven ( good job poking fun genre made legend ) patting back directed first nightmare movie none others , tatum , sidney's friend , mentions director , wes carpenter , obviously homage writer kevin williamson craven , also director john carpenter . cast well chosen , neve campbell pulls good heroine ( unlike horror film heroines , * * act ) , drew barrymore good janet leigh impression little time film , david arquette impressive . also good ( funny ) role henry winkler ( " fonz " ) school principal . took half point unnecessary ( albeit limited ) appearance friends' courteney cox reporter , gail edwards , sidney's rival covered mother's disappearance . hate show , hate actors . they're untalented , overexposed , overpaid , imho , would think wes craven smart enough know actors overexposed enough , suppose isn't .
