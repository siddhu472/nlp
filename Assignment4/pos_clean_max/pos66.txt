capsule : earthy , experimental , difficult , shockingly frank ( even 1997 ! ) , ultimately refreshing story black man run cops . first minutes sweet sweetback's baad asssss song ( yes , checked -- that's correct number ss ) without dialogue , eerie montages sounds . young boy , obviously malnourished , taken fed several loving mother-surrogate figures . one takes boy bed sexual initation ( underneath title credits ) that's far confrontatory shocking ten basic instincts -- probably directness clumsiness real life , something we're used seeing screen . one tough movie swallow , matter , probably reflects pallid unchallenging movies gotten lately . ( suspect sex scenes movies like el topo salo would probably melt synapses modern audiences . ) plot simple simpleminded . sweetback , hassled two white cops apparently looking excuse beat black man , breaks bonds runs like hell . along way moves good many kinds environments seen serious light movies -- , matter : slums , missions , ghetto . , lesser , movies , sweetback would machine-gunning everything sight end credits would roll pile bodies ; one , get taken kind tour depressing anarchic world sweetback takes granted . ssbas first appeared 1971 promptly rated x ( " all-white jury " , director melvin van peebles crowed legendary ad campaigns ) , it's hardly surprising . there's good deal sex movie , it's handled way that's unsettlingly frank -- frankness spills rest movie . one scene , sweetback visits friend's house hope getting sanctuary , man chats toilet . we're used coming close people real life , let alone movies -- especially people made glamorous . movie also full experimental stylistics relatively unused today , probably seem curiously fresh new van peebles' hands . one scene , man interrogated cops , loaded full menacing energy fire gun inches ears , suggest deafness cleverly edited soundtrack . another note : ssbas much anti-white ( would easy ) anti-authority , movie goes demonstrate , authority exists many forms -- governments , churches , even paranoid inside one's mind . ssbas ultimately thirsting freedom -- looks like could use little movie diet , god knows .
