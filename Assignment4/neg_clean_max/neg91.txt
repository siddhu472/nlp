thirteenth floor bland , obligatory exercise genre film-making . hadn't recently watched matrix open eyes -- similar far superior -- might little nicer picture . craig bierko makes adequate hero douglas hall , rich co-creator perfect human world simulation suddenly blamed murder boss ( armin mueller-stahl ) . everything subtle smart previously mentioned films battered heads one , characters stare maddeningly-long periods time refuse communicate realistic level . acting okay , film suffers every logical flaw one could think , features script ( co-penned director josef rusnak ) loaded cliches stock characters . individual scenes ideas work -- like thought sentient computer program -- none film's strengths recognized meaningful degree . producer roland emmerich , based previous directorial efforts , seems hell-bent bringing us ultimate standard mediocre science-fiction .
