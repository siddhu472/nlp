yet another brainless teen flick , one , surprise , drugs sex . stars katie holmes sarah polly couldn't look bored . characters cardboard cut-outs every cliched teenager . one thing need know really hated movie . everything annoyed hell . acting , script , plot , ending . director ( fluke hit swingers ) could well directed bunch no-name actors watchabe film . " big " stars go pretty much drown project originality . felt like watching dawson's creek episode 200 . although film still would stayed red despite cast . " surprise " ending sooo predictable . since male character's sudden outing closet considered surprise hollywood anymore ? ? go dawson's creek + varsity blues - she's = go home watch something else .
