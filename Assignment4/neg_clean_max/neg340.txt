huge success " exorcist " 1973 sequel inevitable , sadly like horror fims make money , filmmakers decided make ridiculous sequel , makes absolutely sense , extremely pointless , wasting linda blair max von sydow completely . needless , dumb sequel flopped box office , never gained much success though voted one worst sequels time , agree . start " story " four years later , regan tormented memories used , priest played richard burton , trying figure demon tried possess regan , demon somehow wants possess ( maybe good something ) . must try stop demon taking regan's body , late . bad things exorcist ii : linda blair , need revive character , really terrible film , brings lull , places seems like stops place , doesn't go anywhere . louise fletcher alright it's worth , could done lot better . direction john boorman , confused , stylish nature really couldn't figure . fact , idea going film , script jumbled , plot jumbled , ending laugh loud hilariosly bad . exorcist fans haven't seen one , recommend renting . actually gave one high rating , worse would deserved zero pumpkins , went easy however fact bit good direction , nothing else ! im saying like film , dont start going anywhere . bad , bad , bad movie .
