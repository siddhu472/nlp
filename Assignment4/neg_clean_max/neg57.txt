seemed like perfect concept . better farrelly brothers , famous writing directing comedies offensive subject matter , make movie guy split personality ? it's exactly sort thing brothers relish : poking fun something serious ( case mental illness ) , throwing care wind get laugh . jim carrey's signed ? even better . national alliance mentally ill even helped levying complaints brothers' new film opening , claiming misrepresenting condition split personality , labeling incorrectly " schizophrenia , " forth . protest seemed like sort thing would , course , add fuel farrelly brothers' fire , proving people couldn't take joke , farrellys would helping enlightened viewers yet another dose brilliantly subversive comedy . yes , seemed perfect , one thing went wrong : movie isn't funny . it's lack trying . farrellys utilize " , & irene " high-concept premise ever : carrey plays charlie baileygaites , man dumped wife midget limo driver , decides bury aggressive feelings deep inside never release . , course , means neighbors exploit entirely too-forgiving nature , making job rhode island state trooper increasingly difficult . soon enough , charlie's repressed aggression manifests second , independent personality named hank , deep-voiced , boorish ogre unafraid taking assertive actions predecessor unable muster . guy isn't crashing car wall barber shop he's insulted , holding little girl's head underwater refused stop jump-roping street . things start getting lost complicated plot farrellys ever attempted , film runs tracks . suggested isn't problem , farrelly brothers' brand humor doesn't require plot work . they're wrong , course : plot greatly instrumental building kind rollicking comic energy infused farrellys' last effort , 1996's " there's something mary . " ( 1999's " outside providence " technically earlier project . ) brothers' earlier film wasn't funny merely contained outrageous gags ( despite newsmagazine articles would believe ) , rather outrageous gags entirely unexpected . " mary , " farrellys managed several times pull neat sleight-of-hand trick : they'd thinking story going one way , reveal real direction delightfully surprising fashion . " , & irene , " contrast , seems made folks looked " mary " saw surface grossness , missing subtle machinations really made work . produced guys made " mary , " " irene " seems like even bigger disappointment . brothers pile offensive humor , taking shots race , midgets , albinos , mental illness , manner bathroom jokes . haven't come way make fresh " , & irene " comes rote , by-the-numbers , adolescent comedy . plot , carrey forced drive alleged fugitive irene p . waters ( renee zellweger ) , who's trouble anyone knows , back new york , ending that's entirely predictable get-go . ( think charlie irene fall love ? yeah , . ) farrellys introduce scores different characters , none ever manage anything haven't already expected , matter outrageous actions might . compared curveballs farrellys used throwing , stuff almost entirely soft-tossed , presenting obvious problem : gross-out humor loses shock value , it's longer funny , merely gross . jokes work milked effectiveness runs dry . take , example , subplot involving charlie's three black sons ( anthony anderson , mongo brownlee , jerod mixon ) . incongruity funny , three burly black men discussing higher math ghetto language white-bread carrey mouthing said language entirely too-pleasant smile face . end film , they're still schitck hasn't elevated another , funnier level , hasn't dropped either . that's bad , ceases amusing halfway . " , & irene " reeks wasted opportunities . ought focus people react charlie's new personality , charlie deals consequences hank's actions . doesn't really happen nearly every supporting character learns charlie's condition early , don't opportunity surprised . film throws looks like patented farrelly curve scene towards midway point ( involving albino companion charlie irene pick called , appropriately , " whitey " ) , script doesn't go anywhere , instead leaving thread twisting wind awkwardly tying climax . jim carrey gifted comedian , physically vocally , he's left nothing much except contort manner similar steve martin " . " it's great showcase flexibility split-second role-shifting , none terribly funny . carrey doesn't pull stunts don't expect pull , farrellys' script doesn't give anything else pull : situations must perform role-shifting aren't set meaningful way . perhaps carrey take solace fact supporting actors fare better . zellweger's irene strong female lead mary " mary " may part adolescent fantasy , also intelligent strong-willed . irene nothing particular , film never makes clear whether she's ditzy , clever , neither . , gives us nothing latch onto " sane " person film . chris cooper stuck playing exactly one note corrupt fbi agent , character entirely straight-laced movie like . , like others , absolutely nothing unexpected . viewing shapeless mess " , & irene " eventually dissolved , stuck wondering whether farrellys outsmarted . maybe kind comedy work long audiences get wise stop shocked . don't believe -- good filmmakers find ways surprising audiences even people grown attuned style . farrellys indeed good , smart filmmakers ( still think ) , they'll rebound fine . even happens , though , i'll still consider " , & irene " high-caliber misfire .
