( what's dreary lighting ? ) co-writer/director matt reeves brings snap story's midsection ; film briefly comes life hero attempts resolve feelings * another * classmate ( appealing gwyneth paltrow ) . time , though , viewers either fled fallen asleep . tough souls stay marvel sleepy-eyed schwimmer , hound dog head cold , go hour without ever changing expression .
