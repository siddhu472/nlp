man , one wierd movie . similar conspiracy theory couldn't decide genre . first hour standard stock aliens clone , nicely created eerie atmosphere ship . last half hour ? makers blew script airlock decided - " screw , let's kill everybody " . - forget sci-fi . . . movie becomes 100% horror . really dissappointed movie tried scare entirely wrong way . instead using clever tricks trying build scare - movie uses loud noises , sudden camera shifts short quick bursts gore . . . . . yawn . . . . everyone's seen knows expect . one thing done well lead finding happened previous crew . skeletons lying around mangled mashed , ? finally painfully restored - new crew views video . acting isn't bad . . . . . considering actors work anyway , complex interesting dialogue speak . nice camerawork certain sequences though , like hull near bridge event horizon breached camera pans back follow specific objects bounce across deck sucked space . movie could much better . good experienced cast deserved work . nothing new us haven't seen aliens hellraiser .
