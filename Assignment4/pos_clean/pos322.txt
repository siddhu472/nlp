i'm avid fan " alien " saga , review obviously tad biased ( least admitted ) . course , doesn't mean i'm gonna giving four-star review something , " alien : resurrection , " fourth film cool-as-hell series absolutely amazing film , much like first two . however , it's good film never fails entertain , consists yet another mutation style series . short , good time . " alien : resurrection " leaves 200 years last one , heroine protagonist , ellen ripley ( sigourney weaver ) , science fiction genre's answer job , killed discovering alien inside body , waiting pop like john hurt first one . course , last one wasn't great anything ( liked , though much first two ) , importantly , wasn't financially successful ( tawdry 55 million bucks ! ) . back , ripley back clone , means get another little satirical look cloning ( that's bad thing , it's becoming cliche ) . she's cloned aboard even futuristic-looking ship called " auriga " doctors ( including necessary bad government guy , dr . wren , played j . e . freeman , well little-seen dr . gediman , played none brad douriff ) , mainly version alien still inside . get past fact can't figure got blood ( although think might blood samples taken charles dance third one ) , film's okay . also board band mercenary pirates , including michael wincott , ron perlman , kim flowers , raymond cruz , dominique pinon ( jeunet sytable ) . . . winona ryder , plays analee call , turns bit secret ( won't state , unless you've shacking salinger past two years , probably know - although it's nicely covered ) . there's bit non-sexual-yet-slightly-homoerotic relationship ripley , it's never really deepened enough . oh well . well , might guessed , alien spawn escape run around ship . pretty much away people ship ( including shocks - dan hedaya , instance , who's death comical yet sad since , well , he's dan hedaya ) , remaining people ( 7 8 ) left try escape stop aliens major harm since ship heading quickly towards earth . course , plot balderdash , excuse good old " alien " -brand fun . real focus series seems style , really substance ( although there's always bit , notably " aliens " relationship ripley little girl ) . what's interesting series film stylistically different approach . " alien " claustrophobic exercise quiet frights . " aliens " wild , tense thriller . " alien 3 " bleak , moody piece semi-noir . " alien 4 " kind like off-beat french film , filled lots humor , cool scares . jean-pierre jeunet ( without usual directing partner , marc caro ) creates ship filled kind scares films like " das boot " , echoes hinting possible threat . chills film really cool , especially music , sometimes turned completely certain scenes ( there's tense surgery scene since " face/off " towards beginning ) . every chill turns bloody mess anything like . combined good old humor makes interesting visually stylistically others . even couple scenes stick afterwards brilliantly executed . one aforementioned surgery scene . another one takes place call ripley , awesome . underwater chase scene ladder scene afterwards one tense , thrilling , jaw-dropping scenes entire saga ( small allusion jeunet's earlier film , " delicatessen " ) . way final alien hysterically cool ( lovely allusion " goldfinger " ) . best scene entire film ( i'm sure i'm first mention ) takes place ripley sees variations cloned ( " 8 " tatooed arm ) . might emotionally stimulating scene entire saga . screenplay joss whedon great piece work , never really deapens lot characters . however , make us care , there's little , looks like one may become alien chow , pretty scared . , yeah , funny lines ( ripley : " fuck get boat ? ! " johner : " well , get . ship . " ) acting good around , stand-out performances ron perlman male chauvenist pig johner , leland orser ( poor bastad " se7en " performed " lust " sin ) anxiety-ridden wannabe woody allen alien inside . winona ryder good , amazing like usually ( although meshes well film ) . course , usual , sigourney weaver steals show . playing variation ripley character ( less emotional , rude bitter ) , pulls still utterly lovable . she's going get oscar nomination like " aliens , " she's awesome . overall , it's thrilling , entertaining film doesn't really amaze like first two , much amazing third installment . style best part film , isn't really bad thing , best part takes away lot depth film occasionally tries apply . it's entertaining hell , it's definitely fit " alien " series .
