plot : human space astronaut accidentally falls upon planet ruled apes . taken prisoner along humans , tries best escape simian captors . oh yeah , mention apes talk ? kewl ! critique : despite film looking like " tim burton movie " lead human character showing signs human , find generally entertained throughout film recommend fun , summer fare . although thing sets movie apart others definitely incredible ape make-up jobs characterizations . mean , completely convinced every single one apes real ! also " give " actors inside costumes , waking three morning every day get make-up slobbered 2-4 hours , coming costumed exteriors selling us characters screen well . especially enjoyed bonham carter's performance , believed developed character entire film ( human ape ) tim roth's bad guy , chewed scenery oozed evil every scene took part . plot-wise , liked beginning film , whole build-up wahlberg got village , escape fight scenes , things got deserted area ( final battle sequence ) , kinda lost bit interest . much intrigued interactions characters whole idea " human beings animals " end battle sequence , seemed bit typical kind film . also hated " kid " character got nerves didn't really care way battle sequence resolved ( won't ruin c'mon guys . . . coulda thought something little plausible , ? ) . thing held movie back anything else lead character , cold demeanor zero chemistry shared either one inter-species love interests . dude didn't seem give rat's ass anyone ultimately didn't really care happened either . i'm sure fault actor script , film suffered . visually , movie also nice look ( especially apes ! ) , definitely expected greater coolness tim burton . " surprise ending " highlighted original planet apes film back 1968 , felt little tacked , despite interesting , didn't really make much sense ( unless look sequel point view ) . overall , loved whole " feel " planet , apes ruled , manner treated humans , screamed , shouted reverted entire evolution chain , didn't appreciate film's lack human character development ( kris kristofferson even movie ? ) fact lead male female humans plain boring . would still recommend film fun , summer movie laughs , creepiness really cool premise . ps : anyone seen original , cannot believe didn't least bring back scene lead human character ( case , mark wahlberg ) goes nuts world he's suddenly thrust ( " mad house ! " - type thing ) . guy film barely seems " put " fact he's surrounded apes speak english ! ! where's joblo coming ? arrival ( 8/10 ) - battlefield earth ( 7/10 ) - godzilla ( 4/10 ) - instinct ( 6/10 ) - mission mars ( 3/10 ) - pitch black ( 7/10 ) - ( 1968 ) planet apes ( 9/10 ) - sleepy hollow ( 8/10 )
