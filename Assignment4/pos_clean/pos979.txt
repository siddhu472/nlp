it's good long since good old fashioned thriller , mostly everything goes right audience wrong characters , it's even longer since saw thriller actually * shock * cared characters , merely judged actually allowed human foibles , flaws , strengths emerge radiantly . i'd saw it's least couple decades , even far back great hitchcock thrillers , though i'm hardly comparing " simple plan " , say , " rear window " " strangers train . " yet it's almost good . it's simple , yet strangely complex , astonishingly rewarding , instead moving plot point plot point , merely laying they-might-be-caught overtones , instead concerns moral corruption depths greed protagonists go , without ever judging either evil even immoral . elegantly directed sam raimi ( yes , ) , " simple plan " concerns discovery crashed plane within bag full millions dollars upright , moderately financially stable working man ( bill paxton ) , dim-witted brother ( billy bob thornton ) , drinking buddy ( brent briscoe ) . without anyone around , possibility one would come looking , three debate debate finally reach decision yes , keep , authorities possible owners cash come looking , generally don't flaunt anything don't want flaunt , they'll keep stored away custody paxton . possibilites circumstance much diverse : ) could endlessly play cat mouse authorities ; b ) could try fight rightful owners , either villainous ; c ) could fight amongst . " simple plan , " though borrows little . little tiff cops , subplot involving alleged fbi agent ( chilling gary cole ) ) , bit inside feuding . , austin powers would say , that's necessarily bag ( baby ) . admired film , makes far superior unique thriller it's successfully able cake eat . effectively involves traditional thriller cliches , like ones mentioned , time , involves deeply way characters become morally corrupt price pay think happiness black duffle bag . steps taken neatly cover things , subsequent steps go miserably awry , film choses never loose sight covering things extent characters , slowly losing souls humanity . one early scene , paxton thornton make trip back plane return money doesn't look like stolen ( bad idea ) , thornton screws ( continuously throughout movie ) , paxton major covering-up ( read : homicide ) . instead quick murder immeadiate hands-washing , raimi shows lengthy , painful shot low-angle onto paxton's face tries sift emotions reach conclusion . there's similar shot afterwards paxton watching murder he's committing taking horror also wonderfully effective , previous shot even better : morally complex gut-wrenching . short , probably best piece direction raimi's ever done , demonstrating sometimes simplest way something yields best results ( proof , watch " persona " 's " sex scene " witness may best scene ingmar bergman's ever done ) . film hardly stops ; follows completely rarely loses sight characters humanity depletion thereof . yet also moves step step graceful method never feel like film merely stamping plot points story . time comes paxton start becoming selfish thus diabolical ( aid pregnant wife , played bridget fonda , pal raimi ) , , soon horror situation escalating tragic heights . there's least two grand shootouts , least one may one greatest shootouts cinema history , arrive , don't come masochistic delight cringe-inducing horror . one , actually sinking chair , mantra " can't , ? " streeming head . fact , film , getting many comparisons coen's [superior , forget it] " fargo , " many similar moments manic insanity , attributed major amount subtlety restraint directors direct , hands , would over-the-top distractedness ( imagine , suppose , robert rodriguez directing . . . , seeing " evil dead " films , i'd hardly assume raimi would able pull something like , although moments film easily dubbed " raimi " moments , rifle-shot notwithstanding ) . instead , raimi directs maturity gentle touch , easily letting story characters co-exist , still letting traditional raimi elements come , like offbeat comic touches . particularly , billy bob thornton's character , jacob , brilliant creation . dim-wittedness often hilarious ( film , every line uttered greeted howling laughter ) , there's authenticity performance strangely enough makes sure we're totally laughing . chuckles gets necessarily ones full-condescension thornton damn real . jacob's multi-dimensional character , stupid , see much flaw , strength character : simplicity endearing many acts commits strong inner strength belief system , primarily towards middle bud co-conspirator begins make heavy waves concerning money . final third film spends much time , many touches upon character , thornton also screenwriter scott b . smith ( adapting book , way ) great . particularly admired back story old high school girlfriend , told thornton sincerity acception cruel story reversed near-sweetness strength saddened character . thornton absolutely brilliant performance , far best performance he's ever given proof he's best character actor contemporary cinema ( don't believe , go back watch wonderful performance " primary colors , " performance would nominated oscar hadn't year ) he's easily able slip character , make completely utterly believable . brings much weight film , character actors , it's difficult picturing anyone else role . rest cast great , paxton's declining working man chelcie ross' amiable town sheriff . even fonda shows talents nicely . complaints film , it's plot almost simplistic , times , seems much like exercise , like cruel test humanity still pays attention humanity involved . occasional narration , usually , annoying ( narration used extreme caution , especially you're trying set things and/or express emotions - didn't raimi watch first murder scene ? ) . , thing usually go wrong movie , ending basically amiss . won't reveal , it's way cruel much outsider set-up , appearance plane wasn't already much anyway . film deals much intimately humanity characters involved , wrong ending . imagine character-controlled ending ; otherwise , it's like " crime punishment " police caught instead breaking confessing . . . i'm comparing " simple plan " dostoevsky . ending work , despite protestations , , something incessantly nagging unsatisfying ; qualms happy clam , ignore go day . despite mere claims , make mistake completely utterly edge seat throughout , even sometimes curdling situations occured , kind gore factor ( , thankfully , minimal ) , film places characters situations gives painful things overcome i've frankly seen much like quite awhile . least since previous worthy hitchcockian masterpiece .
