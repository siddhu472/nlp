" terminator " films made exciting action , " back future " entertaining story , new film " frequency " pulls trick strong package . " frequency " filled plot holes ? yes . matter ? really . film opens october 1969 . firefighter frank sullivan ( dennis quaid ) puts life line every time suits job , goes home loving wife julia ( elizabeth mitchell ) son johnny ( daniel henson ) . double-pronged story flashes forward 1999 , johnny ( jim caviezel ) grown working police detective . strange occurrence -- appearance aurora borealis new york city -- allows father son communicate ham radio frank used '69 john found present day . though initially skeptical idea , john eventually takes opportunity warn father impending death warehouse fire , succeeds saving frank certain doom . flooded memories full life father alive , john initially overjoyed , discovers changes timeline disastrous : serial killer would died instead lived kill seven women . frank john must work together set things right , john using information gathered future instruct frank past . premise " frequency " unusual , requires getting one important mental hurdle fully accept : john frank ones conscious timeline changed result actions . isn't explained ; go . frank doesn't die fire , john one remembers differently , everyone else remembers new way . concept also runs problems concerning synchronous two realities -- 1969 1999 -- . sometimes frank's changing past results something happening right away john's world , sometimes john gets changes ahead time . , filmmakers might perfectly good explanations , could probably come something fairly convoluted ( nevertheless logical ) thought hard enough ( example , reason john gets advance information serial killer's murders change already happened frank's world , john witnessing * projection * change ) , explanations aren't really point . " frequency " gets cooking , it's riveting little thriller , even confusing . matters film like plot makes sense moment , " frequency " works long keeps moving . film manages engaging despite logical confusion . director gregory hoblit screenwriter toby emmerich structure " frequency " good hollywood entertainment , establishing decent , likable characters , making us care , setting goal reached conflict resolved . liked many creative touches : split screens , allowing us see universe affected realities , greater framework baseball drive action forward . actually uses 1969 mets-orioles world series ( one featured amazin' mets ) great effect -- frank uses john's advance knowledge series outcome convince friends believe . ( admittedly , device may interest baseball fan like . ) even liked final scene , features frank john fighting man simultaneously different time periods . may find scene blindingly confusing , reality shifts start coming fast furious , make sense think ( give script lot leeway ) , let's face : it's darn cool way end film . enough surprises plot twists " frequency " keep toes , result movie avoids growing stagnant . major thing appreciate " frequency " handling father-son relationship . quaid caviezel carry parts easily ; it's rock-solid job actors . relationship instantly credible find human truth behind high concept : would one react able communicate dead relative , future descendant ? watching exchanges frank john give pretty good idea answer question . credibility human relationship absolutely crucial rest film ; don't believe characters , don't care outcome thriller plot . , care , like lead actors . also liked supporting cast members . elizabeth mitchell gets stuck two thankless roles , playing julia doting wife * * mother , still performs admirably . andre braugher , late television show " homicide : life street , " gives nice supporting turn frank's best friend future colleague john . lovely scene diner tries explain situation julia frank's world series predictions come true eyes . braugher strikes perfect facial expression , simultaneously dismayed amused . perhaps thing didn't like " frequency " overly sentimental coda , camera's focus goes little soft baseball theme gets carried overboard . that's film already earned poignancy without resorting cheap tactics . freely acknowledge " frequency " may best work " guy " movie , since focuses male-oriented idea father-son relationships ( echoes " field dreams " easily heard ) , underlying concept universally applicable . wouldn't want speak long-dead parent ? see children turn ?
