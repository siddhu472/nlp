" you'll go ape tarzan it's fun barrel monkeys ! " okay , there's quote case disney wants put something ads movie . disney's latest animated feature throws us right action beginning , skipping usual main title sequence putting us pitching waves small family attempts escape sinking ship . father , mother , infant somehow make shore amidst rousing song phil collins , soon built treehouse would impress swiss family robinson . it's amazing , kinds things work soundtrack . know , unfortunate set circumstances put baby hands kala ( glenn close ) , mother ape recently lost baby predatory leopard . wishes mate family leader , kerchak ( lance henricksen ) , takes infant boy . tarzan much story human boy surviving african jungles one really fit either humanity wild . much tarzan's young life spent trying become one apes eyes peers " father , " occasionally gets trouble matter well-meant attempts . he's looking acceptance , perhaps goal easily identifiable young viewers , one ring true lot adults . really think , story fits right disney formula outcast triumphs end . look back past disney animated features you'll see trend . growing , tarzan ( voiced alex d . linz child , tony goldwyn adult ) couple friends . one ape named terk ( rosie o'donnell ) , paranoid hypochondriac elephant named tantor ( wayne knight ) . provide requisite comic relief ( timon poombah lion king immediately come mind ) perform usual hijinks prescribed disney mold . i'm beginning think anyone write screenplay one films . fill blanks ! see ? " couple zany friends hero might get mischief , cover come rescue needs . we've already fish crab , we've candle teapot , genie dog , stone statues . . . . ape elephant yet ? well , go ! " course , there's gotta romance somewhere along line , jane ( minnie driver ) gets introduced halfway . together father dr . porter ( nigel hawthorne ) big game hunter clayton ( brian blessed ) , jane expedition find study wild gorillas africa . discovers man raised apes enchanted almost immediately , soon shares amusing version compulsory " tarzan , jane " scene . thankfully , aren't exact words . however , found distracting tarzan going " ohh ohh ee ee " one second tells jane name manly voice perfect diction . tell name another ape ? " ohh ohh ee - tarzan - ee ee ohh ? " well , regardless picky nature , romance actually works disney romance : purely contrived , reason rather believable . hey , tarzan's young adult . think dated female apes meeting jane ? isn't illegal countries ? oh , well . don't think disney using quote anymore . tarzan departs usual disney feature one musical . there's lots music sure , single character song whole hour half running time . instead get phil collins concert , less five original songs used interlude material . isn't really bad thing , songs high-energy catchy ( found singing one following day ) ; it's different . favor see film theater good sound system , music come astonishingly well really enhance movie . new feature , disney animation gets even better . necessarily leaps bounds , since put new film year , steady rate improvement apparent , definitely shows tarzan . couple scenes animation achieves near 3-d effect , number scenes feature tarzan moving trees absolutely dizzying . way slides tree limbs trunks reminiscent skateboarding rollerblading maneuvers , thinking isn't tarzan , it's " extreme tarzan . " however , tarzan seem call " chandelier scene , " one scene animators chosen devote inordinate amount effort , utilizing computer-assisted process makes animation absolutely breathtaking . lasting seconds , it's signature nearly every disney animated feature since beauty beast , castle ballroom chandelier rendered stunning detail . usual , voice talent snuff , convincingly make believe convictions animated characters . one poor choice casting , however , rosie o'donnell . going film , didn't know even part , terk started talking , recognized voice immediately . performance fine , rest film kept thinking , " that's boy ape , rosie o'donnell . " distracting say least . i'll admit i've never read edgar rice burroughs story " tarzan apes , " couldn't tell true film stays book . unless you're purist , objections film . solid performances , action , adventure , bit romance , great music animation , tarzan appeal kids kid us . note : wrote review mulan year ago , went promotional merchandising tie-ins prevalent release disney animated feature . time , i'll say went mcdonald's yesterday treat mcflurry , tarzan cup . 'nuff said .
