[theater rating : * * * * : excellent seats , sound picture] ( critic's note : review longest i've ever written still scratches surface . i'd recommend read seen film form critical analysis . ) friend fellow film critic ted prigge said review `the phantom menace' - even write review ? never mind fact i've waiting new `star wars' movie since seven years old . never mind fact everyone internet already dissected discussed movie even released . never mind there's much going movie terms plot , action , special effects long-term story analyze every aspect would take lot time energy still wouldn't cover everything . also like ted reviews , i'll try review way different usual reviews instead write casually possible talking directly , reader . begin analyzing specific aspects film , many general significant factors must considered ( get specifics film , skip next four paragraphs ) . made obvious last several years , another trilogy films produced account [missing] initial three installments `star wars' series ( first films actually episode four , one ) . george lucas , creator series , probably assumed people know first-produced trilogy ( `star wars , ' `the empire strikes back' `return jedi' ) actually second trilogy , chronologically . media interviews past explained movies made order , can't recall reasons . new film writer director also assumed viewers least vaguely familiar storylines significant plot points first trilogy ( err . . . second trilogy . . . well know mean ) . order review thorough many significant points must mentioned , unfortunately , may serve spoilers proceed caution . [critic's note #1 : one personal policy intentionally analyze spoilers would like reviews able make sense reader viewing film reviewed , would nearly impossible film justice without breaking rule . critic's note #2 : reviewing film also breaks universal critics' law reviewing movies , roger ebert coined , `it's movie , . ' many outside factors come play film's plot significance part trilogy , considering modern society , would difficult , impossible simply review film completely autonomous story . ] first catalog know film even going . know young anakin skywalker grow become evil ruler darth vader also father luke skywalker , lead successful revolution empire . know obi-wan `ben' kenobi trainer anakin ways `the force' attempts become jedi knight , would fail thus anakin would fall `dark side . ' also know something `the force' , kind universal force determines fate manipulated whose minds expanded enough believe feel ( jedi ) . don't know sure history ruling galaxy , likely much longer complex government earth . , one fascinating aspects first three films seemed subtle , definite order complexity . also , seems we're supposed familiar details story come thousands comic books paperbacks published years since movies ended . notably , details regarding emperor `empire' `jedi , ' senator last name palpatine . haven't kept `star wars' paraphernalia years , still way know details simply recognizing actor ( voice least ) . `the phantom menace' first chapter long saga , one would assume basic groundwork would laid , including history behind major factors series , especially `the force' jedi knights . unfortunately , film opposite simply builds top must history long detailed could never explained . didn't liked aspect film one reasons falls short greatness . you're going tell story beginning - tell beginning ( possible trilogy complete could another trilogy episodes -1 -3 clarify back story even ? ) . digress . i've said much yet haven't even touched specifics film . necessary `disclaiming' elements go show vast story `star wars' series individual film . get movie unlike three we've come know love since late 1970s . similarity films helps keep spirit series familiar , time seems flaw filmmaking process since sometimes rings unoriginality . basic story rather sorted , complex even confusing times . we're told army known `the trade federation' set blockade around seemingly insignificant planet called naboo . we're given many details clarify back story federation purpose , instead film opts get story moving quickly . we're introduced two jedi , master qui-gon jinn ( neeson ) apprentice obi-wan kenobi ( mcgregor ) . two acting ambassadors sort hopes ending obvious hostility federation planet's queen , amidala ( portman ) . leader federation , alien called viceroy , following orders strange , mythical character - older human man whose face body covered shadowed black robe hood wears . referred lord sidious considering appearance , especially creepy evil voice , obviously one significant characters series . sidious communicates viceroy digital transmissions never person . clearly actual whereabouts something wants keep secret would also reveal identity ( never openly revealed film , clear viewers . feeling we'll delve background next two films ) . doesn't take film long spring action within minutes hero jedi fighting lives film's story begins move along . film doesn't one specific plot works manner films series get one mini-plot adventure top another . many mini-plots-within-plots film would describe gives movie hook . films relied type storytelling , limits technology time , films' screenplays also limiting . sense limitlessness gives `the phantom menace' unique traits . already know , film takes place least generation two original `star wars' trilogy means lot background unclear and/or unexplained may cleared beginning vast epic story . significant storyline involving discovery 10-year-old anakin skywalker ( lloyd ) , qui-gon jinn introduction jedi council . briefly summarize story , jinn stumbles upon skywalker attempt buy parts queen amidala's spaceship damaged efforts free federation . meeting tatooine mostly chance course jinn chalks force . jinn feel skywalker great natural power force , another sub-plot involving bet skywalker fantastic race enter , details significance begin reveal . also provides new elaboration explanation force never mentioned . fact , seems something important upsetting never mentioned . element seriously undermines mystical aspect force transforms something physical scientific completely unnecessary . film's third act major significant elements become tied together rather familiar execution plot . it's funny reality `star wars' world seems embedded mythology , new age-like philosophy religion yet solution major conflicts series violence . technique hasn't used movies real-life situations countless times throughout history . least it's spirit ultimate powers good versus evil fun exciting matter . border cartoonish sometimes , that's film appealing inner child , basic reason entire saga exists become big part modern society . `the phantom menace' delivers exactly you'd expect `star wars' film succeeds well always never truly achieves greatness . many things film we've seen done heart filmmakers concentrated bit story character limited . film far bad least embraces spirit sheer fun movies .
