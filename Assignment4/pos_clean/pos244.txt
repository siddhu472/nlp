richard linklater's " slacker , " made 1991 budget $23 , 000 , immerses twentysomething , college-town culture austin , texas . characters either unemployed work jobs apparently menial worth mentioning . lifestyle sort passive resistance idea people go actively pursue career graduation ; seem content sit around spouting inadequacy american democracy , pervasiveness slave morality , subtle messages pop culture , . ask they've lately , they'll likely reply , " oh , know , hanging . " linklater uses interesting technique examine characters : camera follows one person minutes , someone else walks camera follows person , walks diner another person walking door . . . . it's certainly lot fun listening characters talk : clearly intelligent genuinely insightful ideas , plain weird , think ideas lot profound really . opening monologue , delivered linklater taxi driver , tosses around ideas alternate realities nicely set meandering structure film . characters along way offer observations everything dating relationships history anarchist philosophy , groups pseudo-intellectuals kick around ideas nobility sitting around nothing subtle bribery-based morality " scooby-doo . " part , however , best moments ones involving slightly unhinged types . near beginning , paranoid man follows pedestrian several blocks , warning government conspiracies involving everything global warming secret colonization mars . another man seems collecting televisions , keeping least fifteen sets running time playing tapes graduate student recorded nervous breakdown destroying camera . scene drew big laugh everyone present saw film , man tries achieve closure failed relationship reciting poetry bridge throwing typewriter creek . problem " slacker " starts run steam towards end . since linklater spends minutes character , introduction new characters gets repetitive . many times hear , " hey , what's going ? " " much , ? " " nothing really , hanging around , " gets nerves ; film might well benefited slightly slower pace little bit characterization . dialogue second half film large quite interesting first half ; jfk buff , example , seems like pale imitation previous conspiracy theorist , many characters generally aren't weird unique . instead depicting city populated mostly normal people showing us strangeness might noticed first , linklater shows us oddballs first , stops reminds us ordinary people live . " slacker " good film wonderfully offbeat entertaining comedy , whatever flaws , status cult classic well-deserved . can't help think might even better linklater slowed little bit filmed scenes reverse order .
