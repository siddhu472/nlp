well , i'll admit first heard film ( dante's peak ) could smell 'twister' started . seems we're full fledged return '70's disaster film era . 'twister' , 'dante's peak' , 'volcano' soon 'flood' james cameron's extremly expensive 'titanic' i'll say first enjoyed 'volcano' much 'dantes peak' . part biased usually enjoy anything tommy lee jones appears . i've reading lot movie 'cheezy' 'hokey' really didn't see think entire film . get bored easily film didn't bore minute . another thing , boy bitching today ! , bothers critics go " well thats really possible . " know ? couldn't give bloody damn it's possible , really couldn't . it's freaking movie don't want reality thrown face . want able see impossible , might " " many reviewers seen one many movies ! special effects second star feature . amazing found hard sometimes believe indeed fx la burning ground . incredible job come oscar time ( remember ) notice better thrown way .
