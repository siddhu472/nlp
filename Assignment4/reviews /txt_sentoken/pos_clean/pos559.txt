times success particular film depends entirely one actor's effort . often single performance turn might rather mediocre movie something worthwhile . one comes along , usually try think many people put work movie , way one person could possible carry entire project shoulders . sometimes simply explanation , case " hurricane . " biopic falsely convicted boxer rubin " hurricane " carter would normally called " norman jewison's 'the hurricane , ' " per tradition referring film " belonging " director . though decent work , jewison cannot claim ownership " hurricane , " one reason film works , name denzel washington . washington plays carter , boxer 1967 convicted late-night shooting bar . jailed 20 years , maintained never committed crimes , remained jail second trial countless appeals . situation changed group canadians moved washington worked freeing carter . efforts group carter's lawyers , eventually freed case heard federal court judge ruled rubin carter unfairly convicted . film details carter's childhood , jail efforts racist cop ( dan hedaya ) . finally got prison good , carter became rising star middleweight pro boxer , seemingly career track , police framed multiple homicide . despite efforts political activists celebrities , remained imprisoned . flash forward 1983 , lesra ( vicellous reon shannon ) young african-american boy , living group canadian tutors , reads book carter wrote prison . book , entitled " sixteenth round , " opens young lesra's eyes injustice carter's life , vows help free incarcerated boxer . lesra convinces canadian friends ( deborah unger , liev schreiber , john hannah ) work towards goal . " hurricane " leans denzel washington . must carry virtually every scene sheer force , brilliantly . it's probably accurate say washington embody rubin carter , plays character far stronger nobler real person could hope . would perhaps accurate say washington embodies character rubin carter--a fictional personality invented solely film . actor's work masterful ; washington throws every moment , refusing keep audience arm's length . feel everything feels : humiliation return prison fighting hard make something life , pain order wife give fight , utter despair feels coming conclusion hope lost . washington's performance weight emotional depth . doesn't merely play angry , happy , sad ; feels deepest level . work masterful , half film realized scene watching would nearly affecting hands another actor . norman jewison directs film , reasonably good job pacing shot selection . " hurricane " moves quickly , scene drawn much necessary narrative galloping along nicely . jewison handles multiple flashbacks well ; audience always aware time place scene , nothing terribly confusing . boxing scenes , constructed clear inspiration " raging bull , " get inside action well , believable real sports footage . jewison puts together particularly nice scene utilizing pretty cool trick : carter sent solitary confinement 90 days refuses wear prison uniform , jewison , assisted wonderful acting game washington , shows carter gradually starts lose mind constant solitude , eventually get three rubin carters arguing one cell . jewison's best achievement " hurricane " succeeding showing carter becomes embittered man hard-knock life , able break bitterness learn trust people . sadly , though , film's chief failures lie screenplay , good-but-not-great efforts round pike winter . much interest viewer " hurricane , " seems every time film gets chance take clich ? d route possible , . take look supporting characters , example , drawn either entirely good entirely evil . carter lesra ( played nicely shannon , deserves credit ) real people ; everyone else stereotype . canadians good . cops bad . canadians spend time dolefully grinning lovey-dovey commune ( commune , despite film's failure make clear ) , every racist cop ( especially dan hedaya's ) melts shadows glowers every black person enters room . much dialogue comes rather hokey ( " hate put prison . love's gonna bust . " ) , big courtroom climax everyone gets make impassioned speech could lifted made-for-tv lifetime special . it's bad . cast game , director job , subject matter interesting , script takes safer , slightly boring route far often . wanted real reason cop hold grudge carter " he's racist pig . " wanted evidence canadians real people faults virtues instead bunch saintly crusaders looking justice . short , wanted see film less distorted lens . criticism levied liberties " hurricane " takes truth really happened carter , much deserved . example , film gives us boxing scene showing carter pummeling defending champ joey giardello , screwed judges , ruled giardello winner . accounts fight , however , carter losing fairly . furthermore , much carter's criminal past conveniently left film , convicted second trial never really explained . course , " hurricane " works mainly fable , digressions truth excused least partially , even dismissing issues don't remove one fact : " hurricane " highly flawed film . one actor could made schmaltzy , predictable picture like work well , it's good thing " hurricane " actor . carter quoted saying , " denzel washington making look good , " he's one . washington makes film look good . denzel washington's " hurricane . " sounds pretty good .
