steven spielberg's " amistad , " based true story group africans revolted board slave ship , captured taken america legal dispute ensued " owned " , concerned several different aspects story . first , film addresses issue inherent evils slavery . second , deals historical involvement several american politicians case , including president martin van buren former president john quincy adams ( anthony hopkins ) . last , importantly , examines cultural confusion experienced africans forced slavery damage done native culture africa slave trade . " amistad " succeeds least partly three elements . admit little skeptical much could really get another " anti-slavery " movie . seen several movies documentaries slavery , doubted much didn't already know . fortunately , turned wrong . one thing , spielberg's camera never gets near southern plantation instead sticks slave ships slave traders' operations africa , " amistad " dealing different part history slavery beginning . images , fact , much harrowing usually see movies slavery . one scene middle , crew slave ship dispose " excess " slaves throwing overboard drown , one disturbing film images year . spielberg digs farther evils slavery expecting would , fact probably goes far movie director without getting nc-17 rating . stark suffering africans contrasted sharply shallow luxury politicians , president van buren queen isabella spain , whose naval officers involved legal dispute small child time . exposing politicians narrow-minded , opportunistic hypocrites fairly standard stuff , course , spielberg writer david franzoni well enough still comes something simple exercise audience manipulation . film also examines contentious nature slavery issue time , john quincy adams ( probably politicians like ) , clearly disapproved practice , reluctant get involved case appealed way supreme court . biggest success " amistad " probably characterization cinque ( djimon hounsou ) , emerges de facto leader kidnapped africans struggles communicate baldwin ( matthew mcconaughey ) , lawyer represents court . cinque , given window native culture , displaced africans try explain prison guards need proper burial dead tribe member , find illustrated version bible try understand story jesus christ . cinque sees dispute clarity simplicity , , contrasts technicalities mechanics legal process political squabbles . " kind country , laws 'almost' work ? " asks baldwin bewilderment , learns case must re-tried supreme court . spielberg's direction tends little bit towards manipulative side times , adds heavy orchestral swell cinque's angry outburst court room . still , isn't enough serious problem . main flaw film , prevents earning four stars , seems like spielberg franzoni can't quite handle issues time , instead settle addressing one separately simply editing results movie . summer's contact , example , dealt several issues , somehow present almost every scene , importantly , resolved . " amistad " tries pull together end speech adams , somehow feels little forced , case speech , lasts almost fifteen minutes , wears welcome halfway . perhaps best way describe : " amistad " three four star films edited one . almost every individual scene works , final product lacking necessary focus coherence , thus less sum parts . however , can't honestly say could done differently , case story comes enough raw emotional power still good film , thus recommend anyone handle disturbing imagery .
