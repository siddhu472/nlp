worst movie i've viewed far 98 . avengers = silly = man dressed bowler hat + woman wearing tight leathers > evil scientists dressed teddy bear suits + greater evil , sir august de wynter wearing kilt . question could gone wrong potentially great idea big name cast ? question probably asked last year's stinker batman robin . feel production got little smug , script little smart direction somehow lost chaos random events collided together form movie . greatest criticism rests fact chemistry emma peel john steed ( thurman fiennes ) ? something vital element 60's tv serial name . dialogue goes tea finer british perks , allow much room character development interaction , except perhaps grate viewer's nerves . one wonders dynamic pair bother kissing end except pure english formality . connery sir august , fair better thurman fiennes . dialogue erratic stormy weather , mostly embarrassing poor quality . movie would prefer never see , believe avengers would good choice . one thing , witness product far inferior three high profile names associated title . cannot understand something poorly produced could released , put one freak happenings nature , like lightning can't see coming hits .
