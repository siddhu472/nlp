' main claim film , special effects , okay . there's nothing impressive , yet complement story well . cgi takes away much human element , however . battle droids example , replacement stormtroopers , characterless little computer graphics , lacking humour humanness came stormtroopers . episode 1 disappointing . it's got high production values , little else . music meandering , except near end . plot gives us no-one root , even care . effects nice , dull . plot goes half hour longer . there's air manufacturing among whole sorry affair , many clich ? catered throughout film . apart remotely exciting pod race sequence , episode 1 dry affair serves little purpose , except make money get us watch episode 2 see happens many unfinished plot lines film . disappointing barely word . rating=
