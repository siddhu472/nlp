staring , george clooney , arnold schwarzenegger , chris o'donnell uma thurman alicia silverstone . well start i'd like say couple things . first , miss michael keaton , miss tim burton would much prefer think last two batman films like dallas dream sequence . even first film batman really 'star' though damn close first couple anyway . 'batman forever' 'batman & robin' he's almost pushed bit player . can't really say clooney ( regardless better kilmer ) good batman . he's given next nothing , might well wouldn't made much difference . , joel schumacher said refuses bend masses hated films cheered return buton wont make batman brooding dark . fine , mean granted 'batman returns' awsome film bit dark sometimes . yet bright neon , campy style killing anything series meant . i'm usually easy films . loved 'con air' films critics slammed . granted film really paper thin , cliche ridden , except one thing , fun . virtually fun film . couldn't cared less . it'll thrill little ones theres violence really , none everyone comes fine end like old tv shows ends everyone laughing . schwarzenegger awful , mean really , really bad . . . coming regular fan work . love movies time basic reason never says much . talks often movie . would much prefered seen patric stewart roll . believe truely like film care least someone film . liked alfred reason behind cheap shot .
