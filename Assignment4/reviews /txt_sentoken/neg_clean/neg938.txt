wolfgang petersen's latest , perfect storm , like pineapple . tastes good arduous peeling digging - try eat fruit , spikes , it's going hurt ? quite bit . ok , maybe confusing analogy , here's main complaint latest man battles nature flick : isn't really much story tell . basically , massachusetts fishing crew goes sea small boat , called andrea gail , gets stuck middle " storm century . " much time take petersen tell story ? nearly enough . spends majority film developing pointless side stories eventually become superfluous . audiences want see storm , want see fight survival get lot cliched , maudlin drivel . last quarter perfect storm utterly perfect every aspect , try lasting first three-quarters . yet read sebastian junger's perfect storm , heard unforgettable tale . based true story , book must found way introduce characters movie version , approach weak . using wonderfully patriotic score james horner , petersen almost hides in-your-face banality . right away central characters introduced : gritty , determined captain ( george clooney ) , ingenue ( mark wahlberg ) torn job girlfriend ( diane lane ) , loving father ( john c . reilly ) , comic relief who's always trying get laid ( john hawkes ) , new guy ( william fichtner ) immediately antagonizes crewmate quiet , french guy ( allen payne ) . many problems strike opening segment film remaining portions directly suffer . all-star cast's fault , characters designed portrayal . allen payne's character never speaks entire movie , mute , he's never given lines ! supposed root guy whose face voice never given chance interact ? fichtner's character terribly underdeveloped - don't know he's , he's , he's supposed . remaining four fishermen cardboard stereotypes ( hawkes says female stranger one scene " know would look good ? ! " ooooh real creative ) . script advances andrea gail floats farther waters , crew continues feel human . storm takes center stage movie jump sleepwalk . computer-generated images gigantic waves crashing helpless boat thunderously real . imagine imax film , city kid would surely never go water . loud , jolting entertainment - adjectives completely negate rest film . perfect storm unfortunately disappointment . maelstrom lived potential everything else failed . guess i'll stick survival spectacle ? know one cbs ?
