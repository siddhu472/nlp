following review encompasses two versions dune : dune : theatrical version ( 1984 ) runtime : 137 minutes capsule review : cut two hours nervous studio executives , theatrical version dune spectacular mess may incomprehensible unfamiliar book . film's visual splendour , mystical beauty impressive action scenes partly compensate gaping holes narrative . dune : extended version ( 1988 ) runtime : 189 minutes capsule review : bit throw-together assembled mca tv special projects cable television . disowned director david lynch it's considerably closer original vision virtue improved characterisation clearer storyline . quality dubs version out-of-print japanese laserdisc release available various dealers world wide web . * * * review * * * released 1984 made mammoth budget $40 million , film frank herbert's cult novel dune eagerly awaited sci-fi fans . director david lynch ( blue velvet , eraserhead , twin peaks ) working biggest production date , mammoth undertaking filmed trying conditions location mexico . screenplay lynch's , chosen script submitted original author herbert rejected . dune set universe ruled powerful families overseen successive line emperors . key cosmic power planet arrakis ( dune ) , windswept desert planet that's home giant sandworms precious spice melange . spice valuable commodity universe . extends life expands consciousness consume . importantly , allows navigators spacing guild ( human hideously mutated ) " fold space " navigate spacecraft across mammoth distances instantaneously , enabling interstellar commerce trade flourish . lynch's film necessity excises parts book retaining story's two main strands . one long-standing rivalry two families , houses atreides house harkonnen , battle lucrative mining rights arrakis . second strand emergence young paul atreides reluctant messiah long-awaited natives arrakis , fremen . deeply religious fremen want control homeworld , young paul may fulfilment prophecy man would come outer worlds lead freedom . unfortunately , epic story unfolds confusing haphazard manner theatrical cut film , runs 30 60 minutes shorter lynch originally intended . thinking among universal's oh-so-wise money men films two hours duration popular audiences time would well box office . lynch's initial cut running closer three hours , studio demanded cuts made . great idea ! trim already complex film make almost incomprehensible ? glaring consequence one-eyed stupidity hopelessly jumpy narrative , leaving us badly underdeveloped characters . thus personalities vague , motivations unclear , case paul's father duke leto , demise rather meaningless . end result distinct chill : can't warm cast don't care much . hardly helps voice-over narration sparse dune-esque language terminology sounds like much gobbledegook unfamiliar book . dune also serous film . constant " self-talk " various characters makes serious self-absorbed times may find hard wince embarrassment . overall impression world full people intense one allowed joke lest universe come crashing around . humour - least gentle kind humour distinct harkonnen's mad , sadistic kind - hard find . may balk comparison , writer lynch could well done lessons george lucus' star wars trilogy . theatrical version still way complete disaster , however . still possesses enough lynch's stylistic quirks enough visual invention sustain interest viewers taste imaginative sci-fi . special effects whiz carlo rambaldi's giant sandworms awesome sight . production design ( anthony masters ) costume design ( bob ringwood ) striking original . magnificent score toto brian eno one underrated soundtracks last twenty years . elements place benefit freddie francis' lush cinematography , film least feast senses . see widescreen format . despite cuts , several cast members still make strong impression , notably kenneth mcmillan supremely nasty baron vladimir harkonnen . sian phillips also registers strongly reverend mother gaius helen mohiam , leader bene gesserit religious order who's secret aim manipulate paul's destiny shadowy ends . paul atreides , young kyle maclachlan starts somewhat shakily , character grows strength performance emerges credible leader fremen crusade . conclusion ? assessment film must take account frank herbert's original novel complex piece work presents tough challenge filmmaker . david lynch took brave stab , partly due forces beyond control , ended officially released version fails several key respects . dune certainly confused frustrated lot people release . many chose stay away altogether , film's disastrous box office showing attests . extended version , however , rather different beast . 1984 lynch stated intention release special edition " director's cut " film home video , clear indication dissatisfaction version ended theatres . , alas , failed , choosing move projects . way , , partly lynch's fault appeared instead unauthorised extended version , put together 1988 mca tv special projects airing cable networks usa . stung action , lynch successfully petitioned director's guild take name credits replace " allen smithee " , standard pseudonym directors wish disown work . also screenwriting credit changed anonymous " judas booth " . certainly , looking results mca's handiwork there's least half dozen instances , sheer technical sloppiness , good enough reasons director object . gripes must considered light improvements extended cut dune offers several crucial areas . changes involve restoration extension cut scenes addition extra narration , fill many holes original version's storyline . paul's relationship father associates intimate , moments humour warmth lacking previously . political skulduggery involving emperor , spacing guild , bene gesserits two warring houses far better explained . paul's initiation fremen way life arrakis also fleshed considerably . background , new prologue added featuring narration painted stills give us brief history dune universe . piece storytelling , , mca tv's version dune clearly superior . piece editing , however , times surprisingly inept . use painted stills new prologue works well enough , occasional appearance action begins inappropriate . there's sloppy cutting , , instances shots even appear order . use repeated footage fabricate certain scenes ( eg . ships coming going , soldiers coming going ) times clearly out-of-context . kind thing lynch objected , rightly . also noted several questionable scenes shots theatrical version deleted satisfy censorship demands u . . television . notable omission gratuitous piece nonsense lynch wasn't even herbert's book . scene features baron harkonnen killing beautiful young man front slobbering henchmen pulling " heart plug " . surreal disturbing episode that's lynch-esque adds nothing already know : baron nasty piece work . despite peculiar flaws , , extended version dune generally superior film . , contains 35 minutes restored footage approximately another 15 minutes either altered , fabricated newly created sequences . unless idiosyncratic lynch sudden change heart , " alan smithee " version remains closest we'll get movie . repeated viewings , one suspects closer lynch would prepared admit . still , one century's great science-fiction novels , fans perhaps late herbert would argue dune deserved better fate transfer screen . rumours circulating new six hour mini-series planned production company new amsterdam entertainment 1998 , unlikely heard last dune saga .
