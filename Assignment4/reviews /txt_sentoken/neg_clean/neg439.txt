two really good things say tarzan lost city follows : jane march cute jane , movie thankfully 90 minutes length . haven't already figured , didn't like movie much . plot boring contrived extreme . tarzan ( casper van dien ) left jungle living civilized society . days away impending marriage jane , played aptly named jane march . back former home africa , group looters found key locating lost city . ( mind never really figured actually wanted find city . ) anyway , tarzan's old jungle friend appears vision . tarzan realizes must return africa help stop bad guys finding lost city . leaves jane ( first mistake , opinion ) travels africa . course , jane hot ape man's heals . two reunited africa battle bad guys . sound like dumb explanation plot ? it's actually improvement real thing . acting plain awful . i'm quite sure casper van dien film , wasn't acting . jane march wasn't heck lot better , least easy eyes . compounding bad acting fact many places dialogue obviously re-recorded , i've seen better dubbing old bruce lee movies . added sound problems cinematography . film filled beautiful african scenery . panoramic scenery shots looked overexposed . quite frankly , think could probably better job capturing beauty africa camcorder bunch professional film equipment . special effects . " special effects tarzan movie ? " doubt asking ? yes friends , writers injected place supernatural elements story . probably sake using cgi , since nothing hurt story . parts , weren't bad , nothing special . , little hokey side . except course , got ridiculous climax movie . grand finale's special effects went right toilet point . almost looked like run money . effects noticeably lower quality rest film looked like something amateur video production . took one lesson away watching tarzan lost city -- ape men bones morph skeletal warriors don't mix . stay far away version tarzan .
