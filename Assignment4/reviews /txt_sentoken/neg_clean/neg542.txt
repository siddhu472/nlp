fantastically hyped , godzila finally lumbers onto big screen . film opens footage nuclear testing french polynesian islands , attack boat beast , finally join dr . nick tatopoulos ( broderick looking 17 years old ) research chernobyl . shady u . government guys appear , ask come island massive footprints , looks like giant lizard . what's , beast heading new york . gulp ! although godzilla non stop roller coaster ride , points , something curiously uninvolving unexciting movie . main faults lie acting writing , common problems 'summer blockbuster' movies . broderick pretty useless hero , humour 'tough guy' image . emmerich's previous summer flick , independence day ( 1996 ) wisecracks action jeff goldblum smith , neither . also , maria pitillo , broderick's former girlfriend , useless , chronic disability acting . she's incapable showing emotion , speaks every line way , basically she's total crap . it's french actor jean reno save day , indeed , turning campy performance french secret agent . shame little screen time overlong film . hank azaria also turns crazy cameraman named 'animal' , adds little life picture . also making appearance harry shearer ( probably best know voices simpsons ) slimy news reporter . o . k , acting par , never movies . script ? well , that's par either . emmerich screenwriting pal dean devlin seem caught destruction new york city forgot write script . dialogue banal ( broderick looks lot fish utters 'that's lot fish . ' ) , character development non existent ( reno plays typical frenchman ( 'no croissant ? ' ) , broderick forever remains geeky scientist . ) also , film seriously lacking sense humour . jokes uttered pathetic , there's 'hilarious' running gag siskel ebert . ( mayor mayor ebert , assistant called gene ! ha ha ha ha ! . ) plot dire , end rips jurassic park ( 1993 ) lots baby godzilla's ( . e . velicorapters ) running around new york . right , script acting suck . special effects ? thankfully , they're quite good . godzilla impressive piece cgi , although don't see much movie dark . destruction new york pretty well done aswell . although impressive , can't save godzilla hugely disappointing boring movie . movie goes far long aswell , can't seem decide ending . course , ending leaves possibility sequel . let's hope one never arrives .
