certainly one would rent ed wood's glen glenda ? expecting see good movie , screwy discourse transvestitism betrays level incompetence didn't know possible . fact , wood's infamous plan 9 outer space actually seems pretty tame comparison . watching glen glenda ? found occasionally wondering wood originally made two three separate movies accidentally edited together ; result , actually quite entertaining unintentionally hilarious . movie starts mostly seems like bad documentary , endless , repetitive narration transvestites , difficult transvestite look girlfriend's clothes without able wear , transvestites necessarily homosexuals , main character , glen/glenda ( reminds us probably half dozen times ) " half man half woman , man woman time . " camera work terrible-occasionally camera lingers , say , closed door characters talk off-screen , inexplicably zooms someone's ear nose . wood also makes copious use mostly irrelevant stock footage , leads voiced-over non-sequiturs like , " yes , world busy frightening place , many people driving automobiles . " finally , occasional commentary bela lugosi sort omniscient seems inhabit frankenstein-style laboratory , delivering pointless lines , " people . . . thoughts . . . ideas . . . . " lightning crackles quasi-ominously overhead . wood continued vein , glen glenda ? probably would remembered nothing poorly done documentary occasional inappropriate horror-movie touch . unfortunately , wanders far left field wonder eating funny mushrooms wrote script . " pull string ! pull string ! " announces alarmed lugosi stock footage buffalo appears . another crash lightning lugosi returns , time warning us , " beware . . . beware big green dragon lurks outside door ! . . . eats little boys . . . puppy dogs' tails . . . big fat snails ! " bizarre nightmare sequence , probably meant symbolic instead incredibly stupid , ensues , glen/glenda finds fiance trapped fallen tree-in living room . someone apparently intended sinister " green dragon " ( looks like klingon original star trek series ) appears orchestrating , though film far clear point ( put kindly ) . near end scene-and must confess wood lost completely-is violent sexual encounter couch features two characters even appear rest movie scored goofily upbeat folk music . scene ends ( moment soon ) , glen glenda ? returns documentary style , point lingering sense wood slightest idea pretty much gone . film wanders dumb happy ending also seems abandon much trying say transvestitism , point didn't matter much happened . soon aforementioned sex scene , glen glenda ? pretty much cemented place mind incoherent film ever seen . honestly think picked camcorder deliberately tried make worst movie possibly could , still might match glen glenda ? sheer cinematic disaster . giving movie f , i'm sure quite justice .
