" television series , top secret ! , three naked gun films , two hot shots ! movies finally reached desperate dead-end spy hard . even ezio gregio's silence hams arguably funnier over-extended spy- action-movie spoof . leslie nielsen stars secret agent wd-40 , returns retirement battle old nemesis , general rancor ( cackling andy griffith ) . jokes fly every direction hardly hint restraint , timing , tact . movie comprised recycled airplane naked gun gags , recreated movie sequences , soggy star cameos . yeah , maybe * * need ray charles driving l . . bus bound speed bump , mr . , hulk hogan , dr . joyce brothers also appear movie ? leslie nielsen plays straight usual dopey flair . something oddly inspiring sight nielsen wearing nun's habit , even resulting sister act spoof silly . bits directly lifted home alone , pulp fiction , true lies , etc . etc . ( adolescent males might enjoy mess , tho . butt shots , breast peeks , penis pokes , flatulence gags , related innuendo right beavis butthead's alley . ) beyond hilarious title sequence " weird " al yankovich performing theme song , spy hard barely stock it's printed . recommendation : duck you're waiting another movie start . stay long enough see camera dart inside weird al's nostril leave . won't miss thing .
