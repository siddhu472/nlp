" mission mars " one annoying movies , middle movie , get sneaking suspicion reason trailer looks good showcased best parts movie : five minutes . " mission " * * give payoff ; come , it's little , late . " mission " good ideas , get lost unbearably boring delivery , dime-a-dozen dialogue , spate good actors wasted cardboard-cutout roles . i'm sure director writers proud hallmark moment came , stretch dramatic moment like silly putty loses charm . glances don't communicate deeper emotions draw five hours end . film spends hour kind stuff , building climax . lot cliched glorification family relationships , marriage , friendship , unite stand divided fall kind crap . spectacular special effects sequences film , give points trying stay true science know ( trying key word ) . sequence martian demonstrating history oddly beautiful touching , mentioned we're sick goddamn thing want movie . great design , good intentions , cigar . you're die hard sci-fi , fx jerry o'connell fan ( character one semblance character ) , don't waste eight bucks . hell , tim robbins died halfway movie , stupid way . that's unforgiveable .
