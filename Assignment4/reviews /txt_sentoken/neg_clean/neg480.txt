" truth told , " supernova " wasn't quite bad thought might . maybe felt sorry actors , maybe thought could decent studio hadn't started tinkering director's ( walter hill ) final cut , causing want name removed . maybe i'm becoming softy . case , didn't find " supernova " bad advance buzz would believe . it's still bad . film takes place aboard medical space vessel " nightingale . " crew includes captain . j . marley ( robert forster ) , new second officer nick vanzant ( james spader ) , head medical officer kaela evers ( angela bassett ) , medical technicians yerzy penalosa ( lou diamond phillips ) danika lund ( robin tunney ) , computer technician benj sotomejor ( wilson cruz ) . attempts " characterization , " means nick shady past involving drug addiction , puts kaela edge , yerzy danika relationship requires make kissy-faces every five minutes , benj ( apparently gay ) love computer ( apparently female ) . don't expect explanation , won't get . anyway , crew gets distress call location deep space failed mining operation sent . dimension jump ( think that's it's called , don't hold ) , captain killed man sent distress signal ( peter facinelli ) brought board . calls troy larson , making supposed son man kaela relationship . bunch really predictable stuff starts happening . seen " alien ? " seen " event horizon " ( lame movie right ) ? good . you've seen " supernova . " post-production cuts , nothing original screenplay , nothing unpredictable either . , one's going think second troy won't turn villain . bigger problem " supernova " can' stick simple plot it's afforded . numerous re-writes ( script may credited three people , it's gross underestimate ) crammed lean 90-minute film tons extraneous plot threads remain underdeveloped . something limping robot shaped like fighter pilot ? ship's computer learn something humanity ? glowing lava lamp artifact troy brought board ? film's title signify , anything ? far tell , refers small plot detail isn't developed , like rest unnecessary story elements . character relationships film also make little sense . reason , every person film keeps sex . get unusually early sex scene phillips tunney within first 10 minutes . bassett spader's characters start hating . fifteen minutes one bottle pear brandy later , they're engaging hanky-panky . troy creepy stranger shows ship , course female crew members fall love . every single shift character interaction happens extremely suddenly , one many obvious clues much film cut . prominent example , however , may fact film starts , opening credits ! furthermore , end film looks like took originally intended opening credits spliced right real end credits . maybe that's film's title mentioned twice end credits , right james spader robert forster . right get shock told movie you're seeing ( lest decide walk upon making discovery ) , might notice movie seems dropped right middle scene , little-to-no introduction characters situations . rest movie feels like skipped middle stuff character changes ( know , explain things ) went point point b . point : danika thoroughly enamored yerzy ready baby . point b : tunney shagging troy yerzy unusually obsessed lava lamp thing . doesn't make sense . since didn't understand anything characters' motivations , care troy abruptly starts murdering one-by-one ( , knocking three 10 minutes ) ? whit . it's shame , cast contains lot talented actors looking something . don't find . bassett spader say every line monotone voice blank expressions faces . sexual tension ? like constipation . maybe they're embarrassed utter howlers " thing made someone powerful god whole lot less nice . " ever find , mind . climax relationship ( taking place transport pod ) probably film's biggest forehead-slapper . troy , peter facinelli inhabits obvious villain history one ever suspected . he' awfully one-note , it's he's given notes work . rest cast even less . tunney stands around looking cute , scared . phillips broods . cruz flirts computer . die star blows something , really wasn't paying much attention . " supernova " pretty awful , i'm cutting little slack merely expected less got . that's . expect good ( whatever reasons may ) , you'll probably hate . even special effects fairly unimpressive , nothing haven' seen , suffice say script isn't going save film . honestly , though , expect film dozen writers director name removed replaced pseudonym ? usually results bad movie , that's " supernova " .
